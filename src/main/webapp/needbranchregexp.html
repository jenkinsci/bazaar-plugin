<div>
If you have big repository and during the first run - branch - the job is aborted,
the bzr repository will be invalid. A very common error message is: 
bzr: ERROR: Not a branch: <tt>PATH</tt>.
<br/>
This option gives us a possibility to automatically re-branch it, if the bzr 
repository is broken.
