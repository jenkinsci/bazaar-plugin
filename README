Integrates Jenkins to Bazaar SCM

Code & Bugs
-----------
See the Wiki page for links to github and bug tracker.

Installing
----------
You should usually just install the Bazaar plugin from your Jenkins
Management console (look under available plugins)

Building
--------

$ mvn hpi:run

This will build the plugin, grab everything needed and start you up a
fresh Jenkins instance on a TCP/IP port for you to test against.

Maven does have a habit of downloading the internet, but it's at least
easy to use to hack on a plugin of something.

Releasing
---------

If you are the maintainer, you can simply:

$ mvn hpi:prepare hpi:release
